# In order to differentiate global scopes from variables, we use a different naming convention. i.e. We use uppercase letters to declare a global variables. 

# Global Variables are very useful, while declaring  constants whose value remain the same throughout the course of the program. 

# For Example:

PI = 3.14159
URL = "https://www.google.com"
print(PI)
print(URL)
